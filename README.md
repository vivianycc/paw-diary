## Technologies

Tale is built using the following technologies:

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  Related tools I used:

  - Styled Component
  - React Router
  - React Hook Forms

- **Firebase**: A cloud-based platform for storing and syncing data in real-time

## Features

**Diary**: With the Diary feature, pet owners can write daily notes for their pets, documenting information about their behavior and overall health.

**Food tracking**: The Food Tracking feature allows users to record the food their pets have eaten by searching for user-generated food information in the database. The app will automatically calculate daily calorie intake based on the amount of food recorded.

**Food Reviews**: This feature enables users to add ratings and comments on specific foods. These reviews can be searched in the database, helping pet owners avoid purchasing foods that their pets dislike.

**Health measurements**: this feature allows users to track various health-related measurements for their pets, such as weight, heart rate, and breathing rate, over different time spans. The data is visualized with graphs to help pet owners see trends over the long term.
